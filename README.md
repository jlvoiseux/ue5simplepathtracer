# A Simple Path Tracer for Unreal Engine 5

In computer graphics, path tracing is a method that models light transport as a series of stochastic rays and allows for
rendering photorealistic images. It is used in many applications, ranging from [offline rendering](https://www.autodesk.com/products/arnold/overview),
to [real-time graphics](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit). The core idea behind this project was to implement a **naive offline path tracer**
(akin to the one described in Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in a Week-end](https://raytracing.github.io/)) in **Unreal Engine 5**,
in order to benefit from the scene edition capabilities of the latter.
